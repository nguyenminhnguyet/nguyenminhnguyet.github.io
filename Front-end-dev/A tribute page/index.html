    Joanne Rowling was born on 31st July 1965 at Yate General Hospital just outside Bristol, and grew up in Gloucestershire in England and in Chepstow, Gwent, in south-east Wales.
    </p>
    <p>
    Her father, Peter, was an aircraft engineer at the Rolls Royce factory in Bristol and her mother, Anne, was a science technician in the Chemistry department at Wyedean Comprehensive, where Jo herself went to school.
    </p>
    <p>
    The young Jo grew up surrounded by books. “I lived for books,’’ she has said. “I was your basic common-or-garden bookworm, complete with freckles and National Health spectacles.”

    <p>Jo wanted to be a writer from an early age. She wrote her first book at the age of six – a story about a rabbit, called ‘Rabbit’. At just eleven, she wrote her first novel – about seven cursed diamonds and the people who owned them.</p>
    <p>Jo left home at eighteen for Exeter University, where she read so widely outside her French and Classics syllabus that she clocked up a fine of £50 for overdue books at the University library. Her knowledge of Classics would one day come in handy for creating the spells in the <em>Harry Potter</em> series, some of which are based on Latin.</p>
    <p>Her course included a year in Paris, where she shared an apartment with an Italian, a Russian and a Spaniard. “I lived in Paris for a year as a student,” Jo tweeted after the 2015 terrorist attacks there. “It’s one of my favourite places on earth.”</p>
    <p>After her degree, she moved to London and worked in a series of jobs, including one as a researcher at Amnesty International.</p>    
    <p>“There in my little office I read hastily scribbled letters smuggled out of totalitarian regimes by men and women who were risking imprisonment to inform the outside world of what was happening to them. My small participation in that process was one of the most humbling and inspiring experiences of my life.”</p>
    <p>Jo conceived the idea of <em>Harry Potter</em> in 1990 while sitting on a delayed train from Manchester to London King’s Cross. Over the next five years, she began to map out all seven books of the series. She wrote mostly in longhand and gradually built up a mass of notes, many of which were scribbled on odd scraps of paper.</p>
    <p>Taking her notes with her, she moved to northern Portugal to teach English as a foreign language, married Jorge Arantes in October 1992 and had a daughter, Jessica, in 1993. When the marriage ended later that year, she returned to the UK to live in Edinburgh, carrying not just Jessica but a suitcase containing the first three chapters of <em>Harry Potter</em> and the <em>Philosopher’s Stone</em>.</p>
    <p>In Edinburgh, Jo trained as a teacher and began teaching in the city’s schools, but she continued to write in every spare moment.</p>
    <p>Having completed the full manuscript, she sent the first three chapters to a number of literary agents, one of whom wrote back asking to see the rest of it. She says it was “the best letter I had ever received in my life.”</p>
    <p>The book was first published by Bloomsbury Children’s Books in June 1997, under the name J.K. Rowling.</p>
    <p>The “K” stands for Kathleen, her paternal grandmother’s name. It was added at her publisher’s request, who thought a book by an obviously female author might not appeal to the target audience of young boys.</p>
    <p>Her first novel was published in the US under a different title, <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</em>, in 1998.  Six further titles followed in the Harry Potter series, each achieving record-breaking success.</p>
    <p>In 2001, the film adaptation of the first book was released by Warner Bros., and was followed by six more book adaptations, concluding with the release of the eighth film, <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2</em>, in 2011.</p>
    <p>J.K. Rowling has also written two small volumes, which appear as the titles of Harry’s school books within the novels. <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em> and <em>Quidditch Through The Ages</em> were published in March 2001 in aid of Comic Relief.</p>
    <p>In December 2008, <em>The Tales of Beedle the Bard</em> was published in aid of her international children’s charity, Lumos.</p>
    <p>In 2012, J.K. Rowling’s digital company Pottermore was launched, where fans can enjoy news, features and articles, as well as content by J.K. Rowling.</p>
    <p>In the same year, J.K. Rowling published her first novel for adults, <em>The Casual Vacancy</em> (Little, Brown), which has now been translated into 44 languages and was adapted for TV by the BBC in 2015.</p>
    <p>Under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith, J.K. Rowling also writes crime novels, featuring private detective Cormoran Strike. The first of these, The Cuckoo’s Calling was published to critical acclaim in 2013, at first without its author’s true identity being known.  The Silkworm followed in 2014, and 2015 saw the publication of Career of Evil.  All are published by Little, Brown. The series is being adapted for a major new television series for BBC One, produced by Brontë Film and Television.</p>
    <p>J.K. Rowling’s 2008 Harvard commencement speech was published in 2015 as an illustrated book, Very Good Lives: The Fringe Benefits of Failure and the Importance of Imagination (Sphere), and sold in aid of Lumos and university-wide financial aid at Harvard.</p>
    <p>In 2016, J.K. Rowling collaborated with Jack Thorne and John Tiffany on an original new story for the stage. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Parts One and Two is now running at The Palace Theatre in London’s West End. The script book was published (Little, Brown) to mark the play’s opening in July 2016, and instantly topped the bestseller lists.</p>
    <p>Also in 2016, J.K. Rowling made her screenwriting debut with the film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a further extension of the Wizarding World, released to critical acclaim in November 2016.  A prequel to Harry Potter, this new adventure of Magizoologist Newt Scamander marked the start of a five-film series to be written by the author.</p>
    <p>J.K. Rowling has been married to Dr Neil Murray since 2001. They live in Edinburgh with their son, David (born 2003) and daughter, Mackenzie (born 2005).</p>
